Regression of Used Car Prices

Regression of Used Car Prices - Kaggle Playground Series S4E9

Welcome to the Regression of Used Car Prices project! This repository is part of my participation in the Kaggle Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 9. The goal of the competition is to predict the prices of used cars based on various attributes.
Overview

In this competition, the objective is to build a regression model to predict the price of used cars. The dataset provided is synthetically generated from real-world data and contains various features related to the characteristics of the cars. This competition is part of a series designed to help the Kaggle community practice machine learning skills on approachable datasets.
Evaluation Metric

The submissions are evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The formula for RMSE is:
RMSE=(1N∑i=1N(yi−y^i)2)12
RMSE=(N1​i=1∑N​(yi​−y^​i​)2)21​

Where:

    yiyi​ is the actual price of the car for instance ii
    y^iy^​i​ is the predicted price for instance ii

Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance.
